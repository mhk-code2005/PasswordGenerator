# PasswordGenerator

# If you have trouble remembering your passwords for specific sites or if you have problems trusting companies such as Google to generate your passwords, then download this code and run the passworder.py 
# You just enter the name of the website and your username, and then this code generates a password and then saves it in the passwords.txt file. If you need to search for your passwords through this app as well, you can do that. You just need to enter a pin number to make sure that it is you who are looking for your passwords and not someone else. The pin is 1111 but you can change it if you go to passworder.py file, line 84.
